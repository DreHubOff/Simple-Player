This application is purely practical!

The main task of this application is to demonstrate my skills 
in working with popular libraries (RxJava, Dagger, Retrofit, Room, Glide), 
as well as to demonstrate my work with the MVVM design pattern.

If you are an experienced programmer, remember this code was written 
by a green developer with no commercial experience!



The application has 2 screens. 
The first is a list with popular films:
